### Booze Clues (Front End Capstone)
This is our Front End Capstone project. My app is called Booze Clues. It is a way for individuals to keep track of specific spirits, wine or beer that they try while enjoying a night out on the town, at home or on vacation. When you are in the moment of relaxation, hanging with your crew or just getting some me time in, it's easy to forget about what you're drinking. But when you taste that one bottle that you just have to have, you don't want to forget what it was. 

I often hear people say.. "I was at this bar the other night and had this bourbon that was excellent, but I can't remember the name?"  Why not create a "Booze Clue" to remind you so that next time you're at that bar or restaurant, you can remember what you had? or take your clue and head to your favorite wine, spirit or craft beer retail store and find the bottle for yourself. Not only just for clues, I also built a way for you to add locations such as distilleries, bars, restaurants or vacation spots to help you keep track of your favorite watering holes. 

As an added feature for all the bourbon collectors out there, I built a section where you can keep track of your own personal collection. The app comes pre-populated with the distilleries across the state, but you can add as many as you like, or delete the existing ones.
